## Simple_File_Manager ##
This WPF desktop app is my university project for OOP programming class.

It provides basic functionalities of a "Total Commander" type of app:

browsing, removing, copying, viewing image and text files, creating directories.


### How to run the app ###

You will need Visual Studio. After cloning the repository you'll have to build the solution.
Once you run it, be careful with deleting files!
